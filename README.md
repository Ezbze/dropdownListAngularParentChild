# DropdownListAngularParentChild

This has a select drop downlist menu, with nested objects that show a pill box, that perform a 2 way communication.
1. Checked/Unchecked in the drop down list will display/hide the pill boxes in the parent component (app.component)
2. Clicking the x on the pillbox on the parent side, will uncheck the label on the drop down list.
